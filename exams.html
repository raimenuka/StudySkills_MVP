                <h2>Different Types of exam</h2>
                <p>Exams can take a variety of forms. Often lecturers use a combination of these forms in a single exam paper. For example, one three hour exam might have a third of its marks devoted to multiple choice type questions, one third to short answer type questions, and one third to essay based questions.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This means that the answer to the question must be chosen from a range of possible answers, given to you as part of the question. You will be asked to choose the answer that you think best fits the question.You would usually be required to indicate the correct answer by writing your answer as (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) in your examination book. <span id="dots">....</span> <span id="more">Some examiners might require you to write the correct answer in full, rather than just give the appropriate letter. Other examiners might require that you circle an answer (or tick the appropriate answer box as indicated) on the question sheet and then hand that sheet up to be marked.</span>

                 <p>Questions in a true/false examination question require you to indicate whether a particular statement is true of false.In an exam you would either ring the correct answer or cross out the incorrect answer if the question sheet had to be handed in.Alternatively, you might be required to write the answer in your examination answer book. <span id="dots">....</span> <span id="more">In a web-based exam you would be required to click on the answer that you think is correct or on the button next to the correct answer.</span>

                    <h3>Short answers</h3>
                </div>
                <p>The length of a short answer is quite flexible. It could range from one word, to a phrase, to a sentence or to a paragraph.Whatever the required format of the short answer, you will almost certainly be tested on memory rather than interpretation. The examiner will be expecting you to produce discrete pieces of information.<span id="dots">....</span> <span id="more">Short answers, as well as multiple choice and true/false examination questions, usually emphasise central issues within the subject. In revising for an exam that uses one or more of these three forms, it is advisable to focus on identifying the main points, and how they might relate to each other.</span></p>
