                <ul>
                    <li>When the exam will be held</li>
                    <li>Where it will be held</li>
                    <li>How much time will be available to complete the exam</li>
                    <li>How the exam will be structured (and/or what type of exam it will be); (See section on different types of exams)</li>
                    <li>What you can take into the exam room</li><li>If you can look at past exam papers</li>

                <p>Revision is an ongoing and cumulative process. It is not wise to leave revision until the night before the exam. You should revise after each lecture and tutorial. Plan your revision across the semester.Good planning and effective preparation will mean that you will not need any last minute cramming efforts.
